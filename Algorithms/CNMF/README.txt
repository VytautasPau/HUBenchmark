What is it?
-----------

CNMF is an algorithm to fuse hyperspectral data with either multispectral or panchromatic data to obtain high-resolution hyperspectral data. This set of Python codes implements the methods described in

    factorization unmixing for hyperspectral and multispectral data fusion,"
